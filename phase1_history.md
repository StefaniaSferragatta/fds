# 03/12 
### Assigniment of methods:
- Gaurav: Decision Tree Classifier
- Mert: Random Forests
- Giacomo: Boosting
- Stefania: Stacking
- Martina: Bagging
---------------------------
# 07/12

### Call summary
- We have all explained the assigned method.
- We have set a new date for the meeting to conclude this "documentation" part on 10/12 after sds test 
- For the next call we would like to decide how to divide tasks for the paramaters optimization, code implementation ...

### Methods 
Summary on methods in *methods_documentation/*

### New notebook
- Updated deprecated libraries and functions
- Deleted unused tuning fucntions 
- Modified notebook is file *machine-learning-for-mental-health-1.ipynb*


### Proposed modification
- Tuning parameters
- Include country info with new dataset
- Change barplot to piechart

---------------------------
# 10/12

### Tasks:

#### Tuning parameters
- Mert and Gaurav: Random Forest and Tree classifiers
- Stefania and Martina linear regression and K-neighbors
- Giacomo ensemble methods 

#### Cross validation
- Mert, Gaurav,Martina and Stefania: Apply cross correlation on ML methods 

#### Select features
- Martina and Stefania: Pick the most correlated parameters for the analysis

### Summary on what we have done so far (feel free to add)
- Updated deprecated libraries and functions
- Deleted unused functions and neural network analysis
- Added country happiness index column
- Changed the list of columns used as parameters for the classification: from random cols to higly correlated cols
- Adapted our code for regression to this dataset
- Documentation on all methods
- Improoved some visualizations
- Tested random forest with different parameters

---------------

# 18/12
New meeting to discuss final resluts on tuning and decide how to visualize this information

-------------------

# 20-21/12
Final meeting for the slides
