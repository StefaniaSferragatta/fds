Our team has chosen to develop an analytical project. \
**Slide 1** \
The study that we’ll take as a model is a prediction analysis of mental health illness. 
We chose it because it offers a variety of different Machine Learning algorithms, its has an interesting and flexible data encoding and also it has an accurate documentation.
Therefore, the goal of the project is to predict whether a patient should be treated or not of his/her mental illness according to the values provided in the dataset. 
What we are going to do is to reproduce the analysis and also try alternative approaches. \
**Slide 2** \
The training dataset is based on a survey made in 2016 by “OSMI Mental Health in Tech”.
The sample size is 1259 and there are 27 parameters which are taken into account.
The ML methods used in this project are: \
    - *Logistic Regression* \
    - *KNeighbors Classifier* \
    - Decision Tree Classifier \
    - Random Forests \
    - Bagging \
    - Boosting \
    - Stacking \
Among the methods implemented by the author, the logistic regression and k neighbors classifier are in our corsework program; for these methods we’ll provide an alternative code to compare the results.
On the other hand, we’ll select a few algorithms among the others, in order to examine in depth their features and rationales. \
**Slide 3** \
The steps of our analysis will be: to test different preprocessing of the dataset and evaluate the accuracy among alternative methods.
For this purpose the banchmark method that we’ll use are the same provided by the author: \
    - Confusion Matrix \
    - ROC curve classifier \
Beside drawing some conclusions on the methods, our ultimate goal is also to provide our pratical interpretations of the results.
